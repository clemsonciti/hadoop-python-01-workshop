# Introduction to Big Data Analytics using Hadoop MapReduce with Python

This full-day workshop aims to provide participants with a detailed knowledge on:

- The concepts of MapReduce programming paradigm
- How this programming paradigm can leverage the characteristics of
the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) to process massive amount of data


By the end of the workshop, the participants are expected to be able to:

- Be able to interact with data stored in HDFS
- Be able to write MapReduce programs in Python and run them on data stored on HDFS
- Be able to interact with YARN, the job scheduler in HDFS to find out information
about the running MapReduce programs
- Be able to analyze YARN log information to debug and optimize MapReduce programs
