title: Introduction to HPC on the Palmetto Cluster
---

> ## Learning objectives {.objectives}
>
> By the end of this workshop, you will be able to
> 
> 1.  Accomplish essential tasks such as logging in to the cluster
>     and transfering files to and from the cluster.  
> 2.  Understand how to use software tools available on the cluster
>     and install you own tools.
> 3.  Run interactive jobs and schedule batch jobs on the cluster.
> 4.  Consult the [User Guide]() and other resources to
>     successfully use the cluster for your own work.      

> ## Prerequesites {.prereq}
> 
> Learners need to be familiar with the unix filesystem,
> e.g., know what the "root" and "home" directories refer to,
> and have knowledge of basic shell commands
> to create and navigate directories
> (`pwd`, `cd`, `ls`, `mkdir`).
> Some experience with a terminal-based text editor
> (such as `nano`) is also desired.
