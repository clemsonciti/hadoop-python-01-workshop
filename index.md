title: Introduction to HPC on the Palmetto Cluster
---

> ## Learning objectives {.objectives}
>
> By the end of this workshop, you will be able to
> 
> 1.  Accomplish essential tasks such as logging in to the cluster
>     and transfering files to and from the cluster.  
> 2.  Understand how to use software tools available on the cluster
>     and install you own tools.
> 3.  Run interactive jobs and schedule batch jobs on the cluster.
> 4.  Consult the [User Guide](http://citi.clemson.edu/palmetto/pages/userguide.html)
>     and other resources to successfully use the cluster for your own work.

> ## Prerequesites {.prereq}
