<p>In this workshop, we will use a command-line interface to interact with the Palmetto cluster, which runs the Linux operating system specifically, <a href="https://www.scientificlinux.org/">Scientific Linux</a>. However, note that these commands can be used on any <em>Unix-based</em> operating system, including Mac OS X.</p>
<p>To be able to run commands on the Palmetto from your own machine, you will first need to be able to log in to the Palmetto. This is known as a <em>remote login</em>. If you run Mac OS X or any other Unix-based operating system on your machine, you can log in remotely by opening a terminal and using the <code>ssh</code> command:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">ssh</span> username@user.palmetto.clemson.edu</code></pre></div>
<p>If you run Windows, you will use the SSH Secure Shell to log in. Click on <code>File &gt; Quick Connect</code>, and use the following parameters (whichever required):</p>
<ul>
<li>Host name: <code>user.palmetto.clemson.edu</code><br />
</li>
<li>User name: Clemson username<br />
</li>
<li>Port number: 22<br />
</li>
<li>Authentication method: none specified</li>
</ul>
<p>When logged in, you are presented with a welcome message and the following “prompt”:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">[<span class="kw">username@user001</span> ~]$ </code></pre></div>
<p>The prompt in a bash shell usually consists of a dollar (<code>$</code>) sign, and shows that the shell is waiting for input. The prompt may also contain other information: this prompt tells you your username and which node you are connected to - <code>user001</code> is the “login” node. It also tells you your current directory, i.e., <code>~</code>, which, as you will learn shortly, is short for your <em>home</em> directory. We will mostly refer to the prompt as just <code>$</code>, i.e.,</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ </code></pre></div>
<h2 id="basic-structure-of-the-cluster">Basic structure of the cluster</h2>
<p><img src="fig/palmetto-structure.png" \
     alt="Structure of the Palmetto Cluster" \
     style="height:350px"></p>
<p>The Palmetto cluster has several “compute” nodes that can perform fast calculations on large amounts of data. It also has a few so-called “service” nodes, that are <em>not</em> meant for this purpose. Instead, they are meant to help users perform other actions such as transfering code and data to and from the cluster.</p>
<p>The most important of these “service” nodes is the login node <code>user001</code>. The login node runs a “server” program that listens for remote logins. On our own machines, we run a “client” program (Secure Shell or <code>ssh</code>) that can talk to this server. Our client program passes our login credentials to this server, and if we are allowed to log in, the server runs a shell for us on the computer it is running on (<code>user0001</code>). Any commands that we enter into this shell are executed not by our own machines, but by <code>user0001</code>.</p>
<p>Another important service node on the Palmetto cluster is the <em>scheduler</em> node. The scheduler decides which users can run their computations on the cluster and when—but more on that later.</p>
