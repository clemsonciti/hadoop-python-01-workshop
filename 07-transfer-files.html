<p>Unlike familiar operating systems such as Microsoft Windows or Apple OS X, however, you will primarily interact with the cluster via a <em>command-line interface</em> (as opposed to a <em>graphical</em> interface).</p>
<p>Interacting with the system through a simple command-line interface is required because there is no room for the computational “overhead” of running a graphical interface, especially not on a large HPC cluster with hundreds of users connecting to the system through remote network connections. Besides, the command line interface is much better suited to automating tasks and performing repetitive actions than the graphical interface.</p>
<p>To be able to run commands on the Palmetto from your own machine, you will first need to be able to log in to the Palmetto. This is known as a <em>remote login</em>. If you run Mac OS X or Linux on your machine, you can log in remotely by opening a terminal and using the <code>ssh</code> command:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">ssh</span> username@user.palmetto.clemson.edu</code></pre></div>
<p>If you run Windows, you will use the SSH Secure Shell to log in. Click on <code>File &gt; Quick Connect</code>, and use the following parameters (whichever required):</p>
<ul>
<li>Host name: <code>user.palmetto.clemson.edu</code><br />
</li>
<li>User name: Clemson username<br />
</li>
<li>Port number: 22<br />
</li>
<li>Authentication method: none specified</li>
</ul>
<p>When logged in, you are presented with a welcome message and the following prompt:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">[<span class="kw">username@user001</span> ~]$ </code></pre></div>
<p>The prompt tells you your username and which node you are connected to - <code>user001</code> is the “login” node. The prompt also tells you your current directory, i.e., <code>~</code>, which is short for your home directory <code>/home/username</code>. We will hereby refer to the prompt as just <code>$</code>, i.e.,</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ </code></pre></div>

<p><img src="fig/palmetto-structure.png" \
     alt="Structure of the Palmetto Cluster" \
     style="height:350px"></p>
<p>The Palmetto cluster has several “compute” nodes that can perform fast calculations on large amounts of data. It also has a few so-called “service” nodes, that are <em>not</em> meant for this purpose. Instead, they are meant to help users perform other actions such as transfering code and data to and from the cluster.</p>
<p>The most important of these “service” nodes is the login node <code>user001</code>. The login node runs a “server” program that listens for remote logins. On our own machines, we run a “client” program (Secure Shell or <code>ssh</code>) that can talk to this server. Our client program passes our login credentials to this server, and if we are allowed to log in, the server runs a shell for us on the computer it is running on (<code>user0001</code>). Any commands that we enter into this shell are executed not by our own machines, but by <code>user0001</code>.</p>
<p>Another important service node on the Palmetto cluster is the <em>scheduler</em> node. The scheduler decides which users can run their computations on the cluster and when—but more on that later.</p>
